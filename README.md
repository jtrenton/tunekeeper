# TuneKeeper

You never know when the magic will come. Who wants to waste time naming clips and then throwing them all into one, jumbled directory? 

TuneKeeper is iOS app for songwriters that automatically names, organizes and bundles sound clips and lyrics together into songs. 

## Motivation

The idea for this app came about through frustrations from using the native Voice Memo iOS app to store sound clips of songs
and song parts. Oftentimes, when my muses are sending me ideas, I don't have time to name the sound clips for fear of losing the flow.
Later, when I work on the chorus of a song, it takes forever to find the verse that I recorded a month ago. Is it 'New Recording 221' or
'New Recording 300'? 

TuneKeeper easily solves that problem. Name your song, tap through to the song part you want to record and GO!
